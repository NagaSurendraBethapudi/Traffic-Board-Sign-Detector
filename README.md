## Who : 
The target users for this applcation are those who drives the vehicles or even in driver less vehicles.
## What :
This model can be implemented in all the future vehicles, so that it can help drivers for better accuracy and it can be helpful for avaoiding the accidents too
## When :
This model can be used all the time by the user when he is driving his vehicle.
## Where :
This model can be deployed in cloud and also can be in application, so that when ever vehicle moves it will capture the live video and will feed to model for getting predictions.
## Why :
This model with some enhancements is useful all the time since, it will tell the user what is the traffic sign board and so that he can alert or it can be used in driver less cars, so that even when the driver is in rest position the car will take him to the respective location.
## How :
People can use this application by installing in their cars
